The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ = 2l.

Maximum number of nodes = 2h + 1 – 1.
Here h is height of a tree. Height is considered
as the maximum number of edges on a path from root to leaf.

Minimum possible height =  ceil(Log2(n+1)) - 1

In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one
more than nodes with two children.

Time Complexity of Tree Traversal: O(n)
