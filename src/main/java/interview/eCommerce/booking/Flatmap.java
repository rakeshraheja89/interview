You have three Arrays.
A = {2, 5, 3, 2, 8,1}
B = {7, 9, 5, 2, 4, 10, 10}
C = {6, 7, 5, 5, 3, 7}

make an array from this three arrays which elements is present in at least two array.

This question was followed by instead of three arrays. If you have a list of array then what will be the solution? Also what will be the time complexity?
